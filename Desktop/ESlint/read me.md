# Eslint

Eslint-
        ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

Intallation:-

Use the code to install the eslint into the local system.
$Sudo npm install -g eslint

you should then setup a configuration file:-
$eslint â€“init

After that, We create Json files where we write the rules that are checked in the JavaScript code.

$touch .eslintrc.json

![alt text](https://github.com/psaini134/ESlint/blob/master/Desktop/ESlint/images/image3.png "Logo Title Text 1")

After these we use 
$subl .   (to open the editor for write the rules into the json file.)

Normally we write the ("extends': "eslint:recommended") to use the all rules that are present in the eslint version that installed into the local system.

We also write the customized rules into the json file and check the rule into the javascript code.

After writing the rules into the json file, we check the javascript code.
to run the command:-

eslit filename.js



![alt text](https://github.com/psaini134/ESlint/blob/master/Desktop/ESlint/images/image7.png "Logo Title Text 1")

$eslint test.js



and use the 'eslint --fix filename.js to fix the error into the file'.
